        The client requests the data and the server shares or serves its data. To achieve this, the two parties have to establish an agreement. That agreement is called the Application Programming Interface or in short, the API.

But this data has to be arranged and formatted into a form that's understandable by end-users who have a wide range of technical experiences and abilities.

This is where HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the whole concept of web development come into play.

What is HTML?
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.

Dictionary.com defines a Markup as:

a set of detailed instructions, usually written on a manuscript to be typeset, concerning style of type, makeup of pages, and the like.
So you can think of HTML as the language used for creating detailed instructions concerning style, type, format, structure and the makeup of a web page before it gets printed (shown to you).

But in the context of web development, we can replace the term ‘printed’ with ‘rendered’ as a more accurate term.

HTML helps you structure your page into elements such as paragraphs, sections, headings, navigation bars, and so on.  

To illustrate what a page looks like, let's create a basic HTML document:
    </p>
    <div>
     <h1>   What is the Internet?</h1>
The internet is simply a network of computers that communicate with each other to send and receive data (information).

Each of these computers on the internet can be distinguished and located by a unique number called an IP Address. An 
IP Address looks something like this: 168.212.226.204
    <h1>
        What is the Web?</h1>
The Web is a subset of the internet.

Like every other computer network out there, the Web is made up of two main components: the web browser client and the web server.

The client requests the data and the server shares or serves its data. To achieve this, the two parties have to establish an agreement. That agreement is called the Application Programming Interface or in short, the API.

But this data has to be arranged and formatted into a form that's understandable by end-users who have a wide range of technical experiences and abilities.

</div>

<h1>This is a first level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into red color</h1>
<h2>This is a second level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into blue color</h2>
<h3>This is a third level heading in HTML. With CSS, I will turn this into green color</h3>
<p>This is a <em>paragragh</em> As you can see, I placed an empahisis on the word "paragraph". Now, I will change also
  the background color of the word "paragraph" to black, and its text color  to green, all with just CSS.</p>
<p>The main essence of this tutorial is to:</p>
  <ul>
     <li>Show you how to format a web document with HTML</li>
     <li>Show you how to design a web page with CSS</li>
     <li>Show you how to program a web document with JavaScript</li>
  </ul>

<p>Next, I am going to add the following two numbers and display the result, all with JavaScript<p/>
  <p>First number:<span id= "firstNum">2</span> <br></p>
  <p>Second number: <span id= "secondNum">7</span> </p>
  <p>Therefore, the sum of the two of those numbers is: <span id= "answer">(placeholder for the answer)</span></p>
  <input type="button" id="sumButton" value="Click to add!">
  <h1>What is CSS?</h1>
  
While HTML is a markup language used to format/structure a web page, CSS is a design language that you use to make your web page look nice and presentable.

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and you use it to improve the appearance of a web page. By adding thoughtful CSS styles, you make your page more attractive and pleasant for the end user to view and use.

Imagine if human beings were just made to have skeletons and bare bones – how would that look? Not nice if you ask me. So CSS is like our skin, hair, and general physical appearance.

You can also use CSS to layout elements by positioning them in specified areas of your page.

To access these elements, you have to “select” them. You can select a single or multiple web elements and specify how you want them to look or be positioned.

The rules that govern this process are called CSS selectors.

With CSS you can set the colour and background of your elements, as well as the typeface, margins, spacing, padding and so much more.

If you remember our example HTML page, we had elements which were pretty self-explanatory. For example, I stated that I would change the color of the level one heading h1 to red.

To illustrate how CSS works, I will be sharing the code which sets the background-color of the three levels of headers to red, blue, and green respectively:

<h1>
    What is JavaScript?</h1>


Now, if HTML is the markup language and CSS is the design language, then JavaScript is the programming language.

If you don’t know what programming is, think of certain actions you take in your daily life:

When you sense danger, you run. When you are hungry, you eat. When you are tired, you sleep. When you are cold, you look for warmth. When crossing a busy road, you calculate the distance of vehicles away from you.

Your brain has been programmed to react in a certain way or do certain things whenever something happens. In this same way, you can program your web page or individual elements to react a certain way and to do something when something else (an event) happens.

You can program actions, conditions, calculations, network requests, concurrent tasks and many other kinds of instructions.

You can access any elements through the Document Object Model API (DOM) and make them change however you want them to.

The DOM is a tree-like representation of the web page that gets loaded into the browser.


<h1>How to Put HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Together</h1>
Together, we use these three languages to format, design, and program web pages.

And when you link together some web pages with hyperlinks, along with all their assets like images, videos, and so on that are on the server computer, it gets rendered into a website.

This rendering typically happens on the front end, where the users can see what's being displayed and interact with it.

On the other hand, data, especially sensitive information like passwords, are stored and supplied from the back end part of the website. This is the part of a website which exists only on the server computer, and isn't displayed 
on the front-end browser. There, the user cannot see or readily access that information.
